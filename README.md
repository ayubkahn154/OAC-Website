This project was created for Orientation Advisory Committee which is a department under the YMCA in Windsor, ON, Canada. This organizagtion helps schedule workshops for the newcomers/refugees, to learn about the government and services that they might require to settle in Canada. The motivation to create this was to help the public users to view all activities that are being held and to get to know the different organizations and the services they have to provide in Windsor, Chatham-Kent and Leamington. The Organization fills out forms in their dashboards which gives the user details in a user-friendly modal view.

Create a user by declaring them admin, so you can access the dashboard in an admin view with access to everything.
